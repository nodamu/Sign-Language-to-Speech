<h2>SIGN LANGUAGE TO SPEECH</h2><br>
<p>This project has two main parts the:</p>
<p>1. The Sign Language Recognition Model </p>
<p>2. The Android App</p>

<h3>MODEL:</h3>
<p>Keras deep learning framework on a tensorflow backend is used to build the model

Tiny YOLO was chosen for this project because its light weight and runs on android very well

We'll be moving through building the network in the python notebook for learning purposes</p>
